        I am a final year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, completing my thesis on <i>Robust Understanding of Task-Oriented Dialogues</i>. A keen engineer and researcher, I am interested in building systems that can understand and reason about the world, with the focus on developing intelligent agents capable of adapting to their users and open-ended environments. Other interests include robustness and uncertainty in large language models, planning for complex tasks, symbolic reasoning and technical AI safety.

    title="ASPERA: A Simulated Environment to Evaluate Planning for Complex Action Execution"
    img="/aspera.png"
    desc="As part of my research internship with Apple's Siri Understanding team, I conducted an initial evaluation of large language models' ability to carry out complex tasks on behalf of users when given access to their digital context. The evaluation uses a simulated execution environment with functional outcome validation and data generation capabilities. Results on a benchmark of 250 complex tasks were presented at ACL 2025 in Vienna."

    title="Programmable Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems with Execution and Policy Feedback"
    img="/pytod3.png"
    desc="Task-oriented dialogue agents provide natural language interfaces for web and mobile applications. Accurate estimation of user-provided task information is crucial for dialogue system success. However, state-of-the-art systems often model state estimation in isolation, without considering user interaction policy and operating environment. During my research internship with Apple's Siri Understanding team, I explored symbolic reasoning techniques that integrate feedback from execution and policy into state estimation. This enables smaller language models to self-correct errors or efficiently communicate with larger models to do so, improving state estimation robustness and accuracy as conversations progress."
